### Introduction

I am currently studying Electronic Information at a lesser-known university. As an electronics enthusiast, I specialize in C language and Verilog. I have a foundational understanding of 51 microcontrollers, STM32, and FPGA development, and I also have practical development experience. I enjoy tinkering with computers and embedded devices. Feel free to message me if you'd like to discuss or exchange ideas with like-minded people!

### Why did I create this website?

As my studies progressed, I started accumulating more and more technical knowledge and small inventions. Whenever I finish a project or learn a new skill, I usually have some thoughts and reflections. If I don't record them, they might be forgotten over time. So, I decided to create this website to share my learning process, experimental records, and small projects. This way, I can organize my thoughts and preserve these materials for future reference and improvement.

### What content will you find on this website?

The content mainly consists of records of what I learn in different courses, the experimental processes I go through, and the challenges I encounter along the way. This helps me consolidate my knowledge and organize my learning outcomes. I also showcase some of the small electronic projects and technical experiments I've worked on, documenting every detail from design to implementation.

In the future, I will continue to update the content, aiming to improve each project and deepen my understanding of electronics.
